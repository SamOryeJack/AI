# ML

## Image Recognition: 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dropout layers for image recognition, utilizing TensorFlow's Keras API to improve generalization and prevent overfitting. The model achieved multi-class classification with data augmentation techniques, compiling with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Text Mining: 
Developed a Python script to extract, process, and visualize textual data from PDF documents. Utilizing libraries such as PyMuPDF and spaCy, the script efficiently extracts text, filters tokens, performs part-of-speech tagging, and conducts named entity recognition (NER). The project also includes visualization of token frequency and dependency parsing, enhancing the understanding and presentation of the extracted data. 

Developed a Python script that conducts a Google search for a specific query, extracts data, and visualizes the results. It uses the googlesearch library to fetch URLs, titles, and descriptions for a query, storing the data in a pandas DataFrame. The text is then cleaned by removing dates, URLs, short words, common stop words, special characters, and custom words. The cleaned text is converted into a single string, which is used to create and display a word cloud visualization, highlighting the most frequent terms.


## Sentiment Analysis: 
Developed a sentiment analysis application using the Sentiment140 dataset, which included preprocessing and analyzing 1.6 million tweets to classify them as positive or negative. The project involved implementing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and a Neural Network, and visualizing their performance. The entire process was conducted in Google Colab, leveraging three methodologies: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings. For the TF-IDF approach, achieved a final accuracy of 77.27% with hyperparameter tuning optimizing a logistic regression model. The Word2Vec approach reached an accuracy of 74.63% using custom Word2Vec embeddings and logistic regression. These projects demonstrate proficiency in NLP, feature extraction, and model optimization techniques, achieving robust performance metrics across different embedding techniques.
