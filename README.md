Machine Learning Models

## Image Recognition: 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dropout layers for image recognition, utilizing TensorFlow's Keras API to improve generalization and prevent overfitting. The model achieved multi-class classification with data augmentation techniques, compiling with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Text Mining: 
Developed a Python script to extract, process, and visualize textual data from PDF documents. Utilizing libraries such as PyMuPDF and spaCy, the script efficiently extracts text, filters tokens, performs part-of-speech tagging, and conducts named entity recognition (NER). The project also includes visualization of token frequency and dependency parsing, enhancing the understanding and presentation of the extracted data. 

## Sentiment Analysis: 
Developed a sentiment analysis application using the Sentiment140 dataset, which included preprocessing and analyzing 1.6 million tweets to classify them as positive or negative. The project involved implementing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and a Neural Network, and visualizing their performance. The entire process was conducted in Google Colab, leveraging techniques like TF-IDF vectorization, dimensionality reduction, and neural network training to achieve accurate sentiment predictions.
